# ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-1 Test Concepts

ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-1 is a standard that provides a common framework for software and system testing. It defines concepts, processes, and terminology that are used in software testing across various industries and domains.

## Overview

ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-1 standard defines the following concepts related to software testing:

- **Test Process** - A set of activities and tasks that are performed to plan, design, execute, and report on software testing.
- **Test Level** - A specific phase in the testing process that is characterized by specific objectives, deliverables, and test types.
- **Test Type** - A specific kind of testing that is performed at a particular test level to achieve specific testing objectives.
- **Test Basis** - The documentation, artifacts, or other inputs that are used to derive test cases.
- **Test Case** - A set of input values, execution preconditions, expected results, and post-conditions that are designed to achieve specific testing objectives.
- **Test Suite** - A collection of test cases that are organized and executed together.
- **Test Environment** - The hardware, software, and other resources that are required to execute tests.
- **Test Execution** - The process of running test cases and collecting results.
- **Test Completion** - The process of summarizing test results, generating reports, and completing test closure activities.
